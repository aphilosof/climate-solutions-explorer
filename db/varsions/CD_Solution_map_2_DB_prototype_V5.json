That holds true for Personal and business partnerships, including the go-to-market partnerships we’ll look at here. In the world of climate and impact solutions, some partnerships can hurt the very systems companies aim to improve. Companies, especially those focused on climate and impact solutions, would be wise to consider moving to a regenerative partnership model. This approach can help ensure that they're not only achieving their growth goals, but also staying true to their sustainability mission. Of course, making this shift will require some essential mindset adjustments and the creation of a new partnership framework. This deep dive will explore: How to think about go-to-market partnerships through a systems lens; Practical partnership frameworks that balance the benefits for the business and the planet; Real-world examples and case studies of climate companies getting this right. By the end, you'll have a clearer understanding of how to cultivate partnerships that truly drive positive impact, rather than intentionally undermining it. After all, the stakes are too high to settle for anything less.",

After decades of line graphs and bar charts, the climate tech industry is beginning to realize that data alone won’t outperform the millions of dollars being spent by the fossil fuel industry on advertising and PR. Lots of people are talking about the importance of storytelling around green initiatives and climate change. Here’s the problem: The majority of discussions never move beyond, “storytelling is important!”. Very few people are actually teaching climate companies how to do it well. So founders, oftentimes brilliant scientists and engineers, fumble through presentations focused on product features, missing the opportunity to tell their audience about product benefits. Startup websites use lots of space to explain how their company is innovative and neglect to talk about why it’s important. They mistakenly believe that storytelling means telling their brand story, when in reality they need to be talking about themselves less. In Part 1 of this series, we explored the ways in which many climate tech startups struggle to explain what they do.

This is clever: The lender’s risk drops as the technology proves itself; each milestone creates real data about asset performance (and thus value); and the company builds a track record of operating history that future lenders can underwrite. But companies can increase the odds of working around the “What’s This Worth?” problem: Start small Begin with corporate debt, venture debt, or (god forbid) equity for initial deployments Build up real performance data (i.e., show me the thing works) Create a secondary market (even if it’s tiny) Be creative with structure Use hybrid instruments that blend debt and equity (and be prepared to flex on advance rate over time) And yet: Nobody knows exactly how batteries degrade over time Technology keeps improving, making old models obsolete faster Charging infrastructure keeps evolving The market — including suppliers, subsidies, and sentiment — keeps shifting If we can’t figure out the value of a used Tesla, then maybe we shouldn’t feel so bad about struggling with space lasers.

                  "description": "In a world where the sun sets every day, one energy source has managed to shine brighter than ever before: solar energy. Just a few decades ago, solar panels were a rare sight. Fast forward to today, and they're starting to be everywhere, powering cities, and offering a glimmer of hope in the fight against climate change. How did a technology once confined to calculators and satellites become the beacon of our renewable energy future? This isn't just a story of photons and panels; it's a tale of global collaboration, strategic innovation, and the relentless pursuit of a brighter tomorrow. Today - with the help of the great book How Solar Energy became Cheap - I will explain the steps that went into the process, and if we can replicate it with other technologies. And to make this journey digestible, we'll use parallels to something we all love: cooking.",

                          "description": "Diving into the world of residential solar. Here's a fun fact: the surge in residential installations is fueled by decreasing system costs and soaring electricity prices. How solar became so affordable?  In 2022, the U.S. residential sector grew by 40% in a year. To put that into perspective, that's 700,000 American households harnessing the sun's power in just twelve months! Yet, the horizon still holds immense potential. Of the 77 million households that could benefit from solar, a mere 6% have taken the plunge. Across the pond in Europe, the narrative is strikingly similar, with a vast majority of buildings—over 90%—still untouched by solar energy. Our Guide to Residential Solar we are covering four topics: The Solar Buyer's Journey: From contemplation to purchase, we break down the steps; Behind the Solar Panels: Ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes?; Outlook: Gazing into the crystal ball to predict market shifts;  Challenges in the Solar Realm: It's not all sunshine; we delve into the industry's pain points; Also stay tuned for our next nstallment, where we'll leverage this foundation to spotlight six frontrunners in the U.S. residential solar scene.",

If so, you’re not alone. The good news: plenty of homeowners are cracking the code on all-electric, zero-carbon living. Take Jennie Montano, for example. Jennie is a homeowner in Austin, Texas, who recently decided to transform her 1970s bungalow into a cleaner, more efficient home. At first, she felt just as stuck as anyone: Which project to do first?; How to afford it?; Who to hire?; Rather than throwing up her hands, Jennie turned the project into a series of manageable steps. And because she is a driftie she built it into a roadmap, and shared her decision making process and decisions along the way, to help us learn about the current solutions and friction points.This one’s for every homeowner thinking about decarbonization and every built-environment founder wanting to understand how customers navigate (or get stuck in) this transition.",

If you’ve ever thought of cement as “just that boring grey stuff holding up buildings,” you’re in for a surprise. Today, we’re diving into one of the most important climate challenges: decarbonizing cement. Cement isn’t just the backbone of modern infrastructure; it’s also responsible for a staggering 8-9% of global emissions. That’s four times the emissions of the aviation industry and on par with some of the biggest national emitters. Innovation in this space isn’t just about technology—it’s about rethinking a 200-year-old industry, overcoming regulatory and commercial hurdles, and scaling solutions fast enough to make a difference.",

We hear about carbon dioxide emissions, carbon tons, and huge efforts ahead. But where are we now, and where do we need to go?. In summary, we are currently looking at a market that will grow exponentially to remove a quarter of our emissions production and help meet the 2050 net zero objective. What will happen after that? Well, we haven’t even talked about legacy emissions. These emissions that we have continuously added to the atmosphere since the industrial revolution add up to 2.3 trillion tons of CO2 and have increased by 150% since 1750.

This domino effect is driving down global fossil fuel demand, as highlighted in RMI’s recent report. From consumer electronics to electric vehicles, batteries are climbing S-curves of adoption, with sales doubling every two to three years. Battery prices have dropped 99% over the past 30 years, while energy density has improved fivefold. This has opened doors for batteries to be used in more applications, further accelerating their growth. The drivers of this change—falling costs, increasing policy support, and rising competition between economic blocs—will only strengthen in the coming years. Explore the evolving landscape of battery technologies, from lithium-ion dominance to the rise of LFP and sodium-ion batteries.

              "description": "When Microsoft announced a 10.5GW renewable energy deal last May (8 times larger than any previous corporate PPA) it grabbed everyone’s attention. At first glance, it looked like a routine “Big Tech goes green” headline. But a closer look shows something else at play: the AI hype is suddenly reshaping not only how we use electricity, but how we finance it, too. How do you fund power plants big enough to run the next generation of AI data centers, when the demand for AI might double power usage by 2026? Traditional project finance formulas can’t keep up with these ticket sizes or uncertain demand. That’s why Wall Street and Big Tech are teaming up to build private mini-utilities, forging new financing structures along the way. In today’s deep dive by Mairi, we’ll see how $10B can bend (almost) everything, except the laws of physics. The banks might move mountains, but they can’t fast-track grid interconnection.",

Here’s the question everyone’s asking: Should we even rebuild in areas that are practically guaranteed to burn again? The answer isn’t a simple yes or no. In fact, LA’s already got some pretty great tools to help future-proof homes: stricter building codes, better materials, and defensible space. The real problem? Balancing safety, affordability, and speed so people actually have places to live. So today we have Gillian break down the tools and tactics we already have at our disposal. From fire-resistant materials and smarter building codes to defensible spaces and software innovations that cut red tape, Gillian maps out how LA can rebuild safer, faster, and more affordably.",

It quietly underpins almost every serious attempt to decarbonize and decentralize. It’s time we stop treating it like a nice-to-have and start backing it like the keystone it is. In today’s deep dive driftie Alex maps where digital public goods already support real-world climate action, from satellite emissions maps to open-source grid simulators, and where funding, policy, and stewardship still fall short. Whether you're deploying mini-grids in West Africa, launching a carbon startup in Oakland, or shaping climate finance in Brussels: open infrastructure is your invisible teammate.

Next, we'll shine a light on the numerous problems with offsets. Finally, we'll observe how the market is currently evolving to solve these problems. It becomes evident that while carbon offset systems offer potential, they grapple with significant challenges, especially concerning governance and oversight. The voluntary market, though smaller in scale, underscores the perils of a laissez-faire approach.

A quick emissions recap: Since 1850, CO2 levels have skyrocketed by 50%, moving from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, with the majority of this increase occurring in recent times. Our penchant for burning resources has not only released greenhouse gases like CO2 and CH4 but also introduced other detrimental pollutants. To keep global temperatures under 1.5°C, proactive carbon removal is non-negotiable. The IPCC emphasizes that mere emission reductions won't cut it; we need to actively pull CO2 out of the atmosphere. By mid-century, the goal is to strike a balance between minimizing emissions and ramping up carbon removal. In this series, we'll navigate the vast expanse of the carbon removal domain, from nature-based and technological CO2 capture methods to CO2 transportation, storage, utilization, and Carbon Offsets.",

Time to dive into Carbon Removal Purchase Agreements and how enhance their effectiveness. In the face of escalating climate change, carbon removal technologies have become vital to meet global climate targets, specifically the 1.5°C temperature cap as outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Despite the urgency, the current development pace of these technologies lags significantly behind the necessary scales. Initiatives like Frontier, backed by major corporations including Stripe and Alphabet, aim to bolster the deployment of these technologies through Advance Market Commitments (AMCs). This support not only promises to amplify innovation but also drives the financial and technological scaling needed. However, the structuring of Carbon Removal Purchase Agreements (CRPAs) carries inherent legal and commercial risks, ranging from technological uncertainties to regulatory shifts and market dynamics. Additionally, trust remains a critical challenge, necessitating high-quality credits and assurances regarding verifiability, additionality and net negativity. This article explores these risks, offering a detailed analysis based on publicly available agreements (those from Stripe), and discusses strategic mitigation approaches essential for cultivating a robust carbon removal market. By addressing these challenges, Buyers1 and Companies2 can navigate the complexities of CRPAs effectively, thereby accelerating the adoption of crucial carbon removal solutions, enhancing trust, and supporting broader climate goals.",

Having explored the origin of Carbon Offsets in Part 1 and the problems plaguing the Voluntary Offset market, we'll now delve into its ongoing evolution. We'll walk you through the offset purchasing process—starting with the traditional Voluntary Carbon market and then to the emerging new market. True to Climate Drift's style, I'll spotlight a company at each phase. Today's article is greatly informed by the insights from this exceptional CTVC post: Giving Carbon Credit Where It's Due. I think their observations are a spot on glimpse into the future of offsets, I'll be referencing their post while spotlighting companies and incorporating our own perspectives. We often say we stand on the shoulders of giants, and in this instance, those giants are Sophie Purdom and Kim Zhou.",

Here’s the question everyone’s asking: Should we even rebuild in areas that are practically guaranteed to burn again? The answer isn’t a simple yes or no. In fact, LA’s already got some pretty great tools to help future-proof homes: stricter building codes, better materials, and defensible space. The real problem? Balancing safety, affordability, and speed so people actually have places to live. So today we have Gillian break down the tools and tactics we already have at our disposal. From fire-resistant materials and smarter building codes to defensible spaces and software innovations that cut red tape, Gillian maps out how LA can rebuild safer, faster, and more affordably.",

The brutal truth is that the traditional startup model, where founders stumble, learn, and usually fail, is a luxury we can’t afford in the race against climate change. Cleantech and deep tech startups must deploy and scale faster and, to do so, should utilize business operators to help ensure success.  A business operator, an experienced executive who manages day-to-day company operations, from sales and marketing to finance and legal, is a crucial early team member for science-driven startups. While brilliant scientists drive innovation, they shouldn't have to learn business through costly mistakes that can cause the startup to fail. Business operators bring proven expertise in scaling companies and accelerating revenue. This partnership frees scientists to focus on breakthroughs while operators navigate the business challenges that often sink promising ventures. The urgency for technology solutions that can fight climate change at scale is apparent. Still, venture capital (VC) investors and accelerators who utilize an outdated network model of business education that worked in SaaS will not realize the return they require or make the impact they desire. Cleantech and deep tech companies that build and generate revenue faster become more investable, generate return on investment (ROI) more reliably, and attract more investment into the space. In this article, I will argue for inserting operators into the early stages of a startup to manage all the business problems that engineers and scientists typically lack the expertise to solve. I will also demonstrate why VCs and accelerators should utilize this approach to increase shareholder returns and promote success for growth.",

A quick emissions recap: Since 1850, CO2 levels have skyrocketed by 50%, moving from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, with the majority of this increase occurring in recent times. Our penchant for burning resources has not only released greenhouse gases like CO2 and CH4 but also introduced other detrimental pollutants. To keep global temperatures under 1.5°C, proactive carbon removal is non-negotiable. The IPCC emphasizes that mere emission reductions won't cut it; we need to actively pull CO2 out of the atmosphere. By mid-century, the goal is to strike a balance between minimizing emissions and ramping up carbon removal. In this series, we'll navigate the vast expanse of the carbon removal domain, from nature-based and technological CO2 capture methods to CO2 transportation, storage, utilization, and Carbon Offsets.",

After deep diving into the Carbon Removal Hype, digging into Carbon Offsets, Climate Drift will now look at the carbon removal challenge ahead of us. We hear about carbon dioxide emissions, carbon tons, and huge efforts ahead. But where are we now, and where do we need to go?. In summary, we are currently looking at a market that will grow exponentially to remove a quarter of our emissions production and help meet the 2050 net zero objective. What will happen after that? Well, we haven’t even talked about legacy emissions. These emissions that we have continuously added to the atmosphere since the industrial revolution add up to 2.3 trillion tons of CO2 and have increased by 150% since 1750.

              "description": "Today, we’re use the fascinating world of cement to see how offtake agreements can make or break a climate startup. Cement might not sound glamorous, but it’s responsible for a 8% of global CO₂ emissions, so if we want to cut carbon fast, cement is exactly where we need to look. But why aren’t we seeing more carbon-free cement offtake? Buckle up: from messy stakeholder ecosystems to razor-thin commodity pricing, we’ll explore the “ABC” (Architecture, Buyers, and Commoditization) of why offtake is so tough. Offtakes are an important step in wide adoption of green cement. Although there are many challenges that exist in gaining offtakes for low-carbon cement, there are many potential first-movers to offtake low-carbon cement. And I’m confident that we are on a path to meaningfully and dramatically reducing the commercial risk of low-carbon cement.",

A quick emissions recap: Since 1850, CO2 levels have skyrocketed by 50%, moving from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, with the majority of this increase occurring in recent times. Our penchant for burning resources has not only released greenhouse gases like CO2 and CH4 but also introduced other detrimental pollutants. To keep global temperatures under 1.5°C, proactive carbon removal is non-negotiable. The IPCC emphasizes that mere emission reductions won't cut it; we need to actively pull CO2 out of the atmosphere. By mid-century, the goal is to strike a balance between minimizing emissions and ramping up carbon removal. In this series, we'll navigate the vast expanse of the carbon removal domain, from nature-based and technological CO2 capture methods to CO2 transportation, storage, utilization, and Carbon Offsets.",

We hear about carbon dioxide emissions, carbon tons, and huge efforts ahead. But where are we now, and where do we need to go?. In summary, we are currently looking at a market that will grow exponentially to remove a quarter of our emissions production and help meet the 2050 net zero objective. What will happen after that? Well, we haven’t even talked about legacy emissions. These emissions that we have continuously added to the atmosphere since the industrial revolution add up to 2.3 trillion tons of CO2 and have increased by 150% since 1750.

                  "description": "I’ve always been drawn to problems—whether tinkering with code or experimenting in the garden for the last 30+ years. That curiosity set me on an early path in STEM, culminating in a degree in Meteorology with minors in Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science. Now, I’m advancing my expertise with a Master’s in AI/ML, refining my skills to tackle the challenges of today—and tomorrow. Professionally, I’ve spent over 15 years working with start-ups and small teams, where the energy and innovation are constant. My focus has been on scaling distributed teams, refining products for market fit, and balancing technical execution with human-centered solutions. Along the way, I’ve cultivated a reputation for thoughtful leadership and collaboration. But my story isn’t just about technology and people—it’s also about purpose. Growing up surrounded by natural beauty, from the pristine forests and lakes of Northwestern Ontario to the less-trodden mountain trails of Hawaii, I developed a deep appreciation for the environment. A connection that inspired me to align my skills with more Personally meaningful work. I’m stoked about channeling my expertise into addressing enteric methane emissions, a high-leverage opportunity for reducing greenhouse gases and improving the livelihoods of both generational producers and their communities while ensuring that food and nutritional security are universal.",

Next, we'll shine a light on the numerous problems with offsets. Finally, we'll observe how the market is currently evolving to solve these problems. It becomes evident that while carbon offset systems offer potential, they grapple with significant challenges, especially concerning governance and oversight. The voluntary market, though smaller in scale, underscores the perils of a laissez-faire approach.

A quick emissions recap: Since 1850, CO2 levels have skyrocketed by 50%, moving from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, with the majority of this increase occurring in recent times. Our penchant for burning resources has not only released greenhouse gases like CO2 and CH4 but also introduced other detrimental pollutants. To keep global temperatures under 1.5°C, proactive carbon removal is non-negotiable. The IPCC emphasizes that mere emission reductions won't cut it; we need to actively pull CO2 out of the atmosphere. By mid-century, the goal is to strike a balance between minimizing emissions and ramping up carbon removal. In this series, we'll navigate the vast expanse of the carbon removal domain, from nature-based and technological CO2 capture methods to CO2 transportation, storage, utilization, and Carbon Offsets.",

Time to dive into Carbon Removal Purchase Agreements and how enhance their effectiveness. In the face of escalating climate change, carbon removal technologies have become vital to meet global climate targets, specifically the 1.5°C temperature cap as outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Despite the urgency, the current development pace of these technologies lags significantly behind the necessary scales. Initiatives like Frontier, backed by major corporations including Stripe and Alphabet, aim to bolster the deployment of these technologies through Advance Market Commitments (AMCs). This support not only promises to amplify innovation but also drives the financial and technological scaling needed. However, the structuring of Carbon Removal Purchase Agreements (CRPAs) carries inherent legal and commercial risks, ranging from technological uncertainties to regulatory shifts and market dynamics. Additionally, trust remains a critical challenge, necessitating high-quality credits and assurances regarding verifiability, additionality and net negativity. This article explores these risks, offering a detailed analysis based on publicly available agreements (those from Stripe), and discusses strategic mitigation approaches essential for cultivating a robust carbon removal market. By addressing these challenges, Buyers1 and Companies2 can navigate the complexities of CRPAs effectively, thereby accelerating the adoption of crucial carbon removal solutions, enhancing trust, and supporting broader climate goals.",

Time to dive into Carbon Removal Purchase Agreements and how enhance their effectiveness. In the face of escalating climate change, carbon removal technologies have become vital to meet global climate targets, specifically the 1.5°C temperature cap as outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Despite the urgency, the current development pace of these technologies lags significantly behind the necessary scales. Initiatives like Frontier, backed by major corporations including Stripe and Alphabet, aim to bolster the deployment of these technologies through Advance Market Commitments (AMCs). This support not only promises to amplify innovation but also drives the financial and technological scaling needed. However, the structuring of Carbon Removal Purchase Agreements (CRPAs) carries inherent legal and commercial risks, ranging from technological uncertainties to regulatory shifts and market dynamics. Additionally, trust remains a critical challenge, necessitating high-quality credits and assurances regarding verifiability, additionality and net negativity. This article explores these risks, offering a detailed analysis based on publicly available agreements (those from Stripe), and discusses strategic mitigation approaches essential for cultivating a robust carbon removal market. By addressing these challenges, Buyers1 and Companies2 can navigate the complexities of CRPAs effectively, thereby accelerating the adoption of crucial carbon removal solutions, enhancing trust, and supporting broader climate goals.",

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has the potential to cut aviation CO2 emissions by 80% over their full lifecycle. The maritime sector, responsible for about 2-3% of global emissions, sees potential in alternative fuels like ammonia, which can reduce ship emissions by 99%. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) can capture up to 90% of the CO2 emissions produced. Electric Vehicles (EVs) on a renewable energy grid can result in 70% fewer emissions than gasoline cars. Electrifying fleets can potentially replace millions of polluting vehicles, while hydrogen trucks offer near-zero emissions, with hydrogen production from green sources being key.",

But this is not the only anxiety that can come with an EV switch. Here, Brenda Tsang tackles EV Anxiety by defining it and highlighting four effective solutions. Throughout my youth, the notion of Personal vehicle ownership seemed superfluous, given the advanced and convenient public transportation infrastructure that defined my upbringing. However, this perspective shifted dramatically upon relocating abroad, where I encountered the stark reality of insufficient public transportation in rural locales, thereby rendering daily commutes exceedingly challenging. Initially, when the time came to purchase my first vehicle, the financial constraints I faced precluded the option of an electric vehicle (EV). Nonetheless, as EVs surged in popularity, became more financially accessible, and my environmental consciousness deepened, the allure of owning a fully electric battery-powered vehicle intensified, ultimately establishing it as my preferred choice. Despite this inclination, a pervasive myth known as \"Range Anxiety\" remains a significant barrier deterring many potential EV purchasers. This phenomenon encapsulates the apprehension that an EV may not possess adequate battery capacity to reach its intended destination. As an enthusiastic proponent of EVs, I am compelled to explore this topic in depth. This article is trying to examine the multifaceted issue of EV anxiety by addressing the following critical aspects: What is EV Anxiety? Why does it happen? Solutions to mitigate EV Anxiety. Evaluation of existing solutions The imperative to resolve the Anxiety among EV; By undertaking a thorough examination of EV anxiety and its impact on potential EV buyers, this article aims to contribute meaningfully to the discourse surrounding electric vehicles, with the ultimate goal of advancing the transition towards more sustainable modes of transportation.",

The good news: plenty of homeowners are cracking the code on all-electric, zero-carbon living. Take Jennie Montano, for example. Jennie is a homeowner in Austin, Texas, who recently decided to transform her 1970s bungalow into a cleaner, more efficient home. At first, she felt just as stuck as anyone: Which project to do first?; How to afford it?; Who to hire?; Rather than throwing up her hands, Jennie turned the project into a series of manageable steps. And because she is a driftie she built it into a roadmap, and shared her decision making process and decisions along the way, to help us learn about the current solutions and friction points.This one’s for every homeowner thinking about decarbonization and every built-environment founder wanting to understand how customers navigate (or get stuck in) this transition.",

Collectively, these sectors account for about 24% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock alone contributes to nearly 14.5% of global emissions, with beef and dairy cattle being the primary culprits. Meanwhile, rice cultivation, responsible for around 10% of agricultural methane emissions, and deforestation, often pursued to create new farmlands, further exacerbate the problem. Additionally, about 70% of global freshwater withdrawals are for agriculture. As climate change becomes more pressing, reimagining these sectors to ensure sustainability while meeting global food demand is crucial. Fortunately, solutions are at hand: from alternative proteins like plant-based meats to efforts in curbing food waste. Let's explore the attendees of The Drop and delve into their solutions:",

Then we will dive into the solutions landscape & see how far the solutions are. Food systems are responsible for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions; from land use change, on-farm production, processing, transport, packaging, and retail. About 30% of food emissions arise directly from livestock and fisheries, with ruminant livestock like cattle being major methane emitters. Additionally, crop production, including both human and animal consumption, accounts for roughly a quarter of food emissions. Various solutions are being explored to reduce emission in food and agriculture. On the farm side we have sensors measuring crop production & emissions, automation, and climate-tolerant crops. Animal farming explores carbon capture techniques, like cattle feed additives. Embracing sustainable methods, we see the rise of regenerative and hydroponic farming. Efforts in food waste revolve around analytics and surplus management, Food Coatings are making sure that food doesn’t spoil in the first place. Last but not least the focus of this series: Alternative proteins, from plant-based meat to fermentation and cultivated meat.",

On some primal level going for the burger on your plate is a much more outrageous act than going for your car. So it’s no surprise that technical-minded people have been looking for a panacea in the form of lab-grown meat. And the pitch is alluring: If the plan works out the burger is safe and we get to reduce our emissions. We get to have our cake and eat it, too. However that “if” is doing a lot of work in this sentence. So today we will have a look at the bear take on lab-grown meat: It might be viable at some point but too late and too ineffectual to be considered a Climate Solution. Even worse: It could distract from the real issue much in the same way that CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) is already being used by Big Oil to prevent actual mitigation.",

Not only are mushrooms simply one of the most sustainable foods you could ever eat, there is a huge variety of flavor, texture and nutrition just waiting to be discovered.  Smallhold initially entered the market as a supplier of fresh mushrooms to restaurants and grocery stores in New York City. Recognizing an opportunity for on-site cultivation, the company launched Minifarms, compact mushroom-growing systems that could be placed in partner hotels and restaurants. The COVID-19 pandemic served as a catalyst for change in Smallhold's business strategy. With more people cooking at home, the demand for unique and quality ingredients like mushrooms increased. The company adapted by adding a direct-to-consumer model, offering mushroom grow kits for home delivery. During this period of uncertainty, Smallhold's mushrooms gained traction as a source of culinary exploration for many households. Customers reveled in watching the unique shapes and colors of their mushrooms grow, and then experimenting with new recipes. After the pandemic Smallhold’s go to market focussed again on retail: Currently, Smallhold's freshly harvested mushrooms are available in over 500 retail stores, including established chains like Whole Foods, Central Market, and Albertsons. Notably, Smallhold has become the fastest-growing fresh mushroom brand in Whole Foods, shifting the chain's previous reliance on California-based small scale suppliers.Welcome to the kingdom of mushrooms (literally, fungi are a kingdom).",

With growing consumer demand for eco-friendly options and brands scrambling to stay ahead, it's not just about packaging—it's about reshaping the entire system and products. But is the industry really ready for change? From the challenges with recycling systems to the complexities of carbon neutrality, we’ll break down what’s working, what’s not, and what needs to change. Let’s not ignore waste and pollution, why the current recycling systems aren’t cutting it, and how brands can adapt to meet the growing demand for sustainable options. Last but not least, we are looking at the problem as consumers: How can we navigate the sea of green claims and make informed choices? The beauty industry is undergoing a transformation as sustainability and circularity take center stage. Consumers and brands alike are exploring new avenues to minimize environmental impact, from routes of consumption and recyclable packaging to refillable products. This report explores the intersections of conscious consumerism, producer responsibility, and the beauty industry's evolving practices toward a greener future whilst avoiding greenwashing and false claims",

We took the long route (15 minutes on a main street) and soon we hit a count of 32 words before even setting foot in the store. As someone who understands the importance of mindful choices and their impact on the planet, how can I make responsible decisions amidst all this greenwashing? I get it – not all companies are out to deceive consumers. Some genuinely want to do good but struggle to convey their efforts effectively. That's why I decided to roll up my sleeves and delve into a topic that hits close to home for me and many of us – greenwashing.  Come along with me as I delve into it and explore within this post: Why does it matter to companies?; What is greenwashing?; How governments are cracking down on deceptive practices; The C.L.E.A.R Framework as a way to authentically communicate sustainability while avoiding greenwashing.",

          "description": "The circular economy emphasizes sharing, reusing, and recycling to extend product longevity, with principles like \"Rethink\" for greener inception, \"Reduce\" for minimizing waste, and \"Recycle\" for advanced material management. We asked around and our friends at Pentatonic responded. Pentatonic is a climate-tech platform accelerating circularity at scale in the world’s largest consumer brands. They are used by customers like L'Oréal, Lego, and Diageo. Transitioning a large, established company to truly circular operations demands a holistic vision: uncoordinated siloed adjustments alone won’t deliver the necessary systemic change across multiple core business domains. In response to this complexity and scale, many companies seek to define staged transitional milestones, often referred to as a ‘circular economy roadmap’ or ‘pathway to circularity’. However, early versions of this roadmap often only serve to reveal the true depth of the change to be navigated. This is entirely normal of course, and it’s clearly better to make a start, make mistakes, and learn some lessons than never begin. We’ve advised and executed with some of the world’s biggest consumer brands when it comes to driving this transition, categorizing a few common pitfalls and misconceptions to avoid along the way. Here are 12 of the most frequent we see.",

          "description": "For the past 12 years I have been working with brands to introduce new physical products to the market. Aside from the specific product type ISO standards and more broad overarching regulations (like the GPSR, REACH and RoHS), how that product is brought to market has been relatively straightforward with little scrutiny. That was until the introduction of the EU’s Green Deal. The game has now changed! Quite rightfully, brands now have a duty to take care of all aspects associated with bringing a new physical artifact into existence. For those that are willing to take the time to understand the scope of the new rules, I believe there is a wealth of opportunity for alternative revenue generation; not just a downpour of data capture mandated by Brussels. These are the brands that will continue to thrive as we transition into the next generation of our economy. Naturally, these are also the brands that I am excited to work with!

GDP measures market output, which is the monetary value of goods/services produced in an economy during a given period. Businesses are measured by how well they do in a stock market, resulting in volatile short-term thinking. Consumers spend a significant amount of time on social media, where they are exposed to information and ads that brands target, often leading to impulse purchases. to transform the current system it will take more than one player, in fact the only way forward is to collaborate and find creative solutions that incentivise everyone to participate. Every industry addresses distinct consumer needs and encounters challenges unique to its business model and operations.

Our government’s overall success is measured by the monetary value of goods produced, encouraging people to buy more. This leads us to an ecological overshoot as we realised our resources are finite. Human and consumptions are inseparable. Our behaviour for consumption is as old as humanity itself. To live is to consume.  Humans have succumbed to advertising ever since the snake whispered into Eve's ear in the Garden of Eden. Eve didn't need the forbidden fruit; there was plenty of other fruit around. But humans have a tendency to want more than what they need. It’s a gradual and unintentional process. We started with Barter and Trade, followed by the Industrial Revolution, the Rise of Advertising, Post World War Boom, and the ongoing evolution of the Technological Revolution. Each phase accelerates our consumption, it also doesn’t help that we think we have an abundant amount of resources. Just like we thought the Earth was flat, we think our economy should be linear. To slow down and manage consumption we need consumers, businesses, and the government to collectively take action and hold each other accountable. In this chapter I will deep dive into the source of our consumption, how it’s changing, and the role each one of us should play in managing consumption.",

Every day, the European Union generates 228,000 tonnes of packaging waste, about the weight of 23 Eiffel Towers. And while recycling exists, a huge amount of packaging material still gets burned, buried, or lost in the environment. But here’s the thing: this isn’t just a sustainability problem; it’s a business opportunity. Companies that figure out how to close the loop, designing for recyclability, securing secondary materials, and leveraging partnerships, will have a real competitive advantage. To unpack this issue (pun intended) driftie Laura presents a new framework to rethink the packaging value chain, covering design, waste collection, and recycling, while breaking down the critical capabilities companies need to build to unlock value. Whether you’re a brand looking to manage Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) costs, a climate investor seeking opportunities, or a recycling company navigating a shifting landscape, this one’s for you.",

This domino effect is driving down global fossil fuel demand, as highlighted in RMI’s recent report. From consumer electronics to electric vehicles, batteries are climbing S-curves of adoption, with sales doubling every two to three years. Battery prices have dropped 99% over the past 30 years, while energy density has improved fivefold. This has opened doors for batteries to be used in more applications, further accelerating their growth. The drivers of this change—falling costs, increasing policy support, and rising competition between economic blocs—will only strengthen in the coming years. Explore the evolving landscape of battery technologies, from lithium-ion dominance to the rise of LFP and sodium-ion batteries. Climate Drifter Harrison Tramposch dives deep into applications, investment needs, and the importance of onshoring for a sustainable future.

Today, in Part 2, we shift our focus to the critical role of reverse logistics—how we can use AI to streamline the return, repair, and reuse of products. The reality is we’ve perfected the art of getting products into consumers’ hands, but we’ve utterly failed at getting them back. This is where reverse logistics comes in—handling everything from returns and repairs to recycling and reuse. The problem? It’s a logistical nightmare, and without AI, it’s nearly impossible to manage at scale. Fortunately, AI is beginning to transform reverse logistics. Companies like Kadeya and Optoro are at the forefront, using new technologies to rethink how products are returned and reused. They’re not just improving existing processes; they’re laying the groundwork for a circular economy that can genuinely make a difference.",

Alongside that, it has impressive accompanying environmental statistics such as being infinitely recyclable with 75% of all Aluminium ever produced still in circulation. With a resume like that, it's easy to see why it has become ubiquitous in daily life with a significant chunk of society seeing it as the poster-boy for closed-loop miracle materials. But is that really the case? Or could it be that Aluminium is in fact not a closed loop at all and that marketing programmes filled with half-truths are stopping us from understanding the full picture? Having spent the last 6 weeks digging into this topic, my short answer to that is: quite possibly! Throughout this article I will use the industry that I know most thoroughly, bicycles & e-bikes, to deep dive on this topic. At the end I’ll close with some practical tips on how to course correct from our current position. Now take a breath. I’ve been working in the bicycle supply chain for +7 years and a lot of what I found here shocked me. Make a cup of tea and take a comfortable seat as we jump down the rabbit hole…",

Our government’s overall success is measured by the monetary value of goods produced, encouraging people to buy more. This leads us to an ecological overshoot as we realised our resources are finite. Human and consumptions are inseparable. Our behaviour for consumption is as old as humanity itself. To live is to consume.  Humans have succumbed to advertising ever since the snake whispered into Eve's ear in the Garden of Eden. Eve didn't need the forbidden fruit; there was plenty of other fruit around. But humans have a tendency to want more than what they need. It’s a gradual and unintentional process. We started with Barter and Trade, followed by the Industrial Revolution, the Rise of Advertising, Post World War Boom, and the ongoing evolution of the Technological Revolution. Each phase accelerates our consumption, it also doesn’t help that we think we have an abundant amount of resources. Just like we thought the Earth was flat, we think our economy should be linear. To slow down and manage consumption we need consumers, businesses, and the government to collectively take action and hold each other accountable. In this chapter I will deep dive into the source of our consumption, how it’s changing, and the role each one of us should play in managing consumption.",

Let’s not ignore waste and pollution, why the current recycling systems aren’t cutting it, and how brands can adapt to meet the growing demand for sustainable options. Last but not least, we are looking at the problem as consumers: How can we navigate the sea of green claims and make informed choices? The beauty industry is undergoing a transformation as sustainability and circularity take center stage.

Our government’s overall success is measured by the monetary value of goods produced, encouraging people to buy more. This leads us to an ecological overshoot as we realised our resources are finite. Human and consumptions are inseparable. Our behaviour for consumption is as old as humanity itself. To live is to consume.  Humans have succumbed to advertising ever since the snake whispered into Eve's ear in the Garden of Eden. Eve didn't need the forbidden fruit; there was plenty of other fruit around. But humans have a tendency to want more than what they need. It’s a gradual and unintentional process. We started with Barter and Trade, followed by the Industrial Revolution, the Rise of Advertising, Post World War Boom, and the ongoing evolution of the Technological Revolution. Each phase accelerates our consumption, it also doesn’t help that we think we have an abundant amount of resources. Just like we thought the Earth was flat, we think our economy should be linear. To slow down and manage consumption we need consumers, businesses, and the government to collectively take action and hold each other accountable. In this chapter I will deep dive into the source of our consumption, how it’s changing, and the role each one of us should play in managing consumption.",

Aside from the specific product type ISO standards and more broad overarching regulations (like the GPSR, REACH and RoHS), how that product is brought to market has been relatively straightforward with little scrutiny. That was until the introduction of the EU’s Green Deal. The game has now changed! Quite rightfully, brands now have a duty to take care of all aspects associated with bringing a new physical artifact into existence. For those that are willing to take the time to understand the scope of the new rules, I believe there is a wealth of opportunity for alternative revenue generation; not just a downpour of data capture mandated by Brussels. These are the brands that will continue to thrive as we transition into the next generation of our economy. Naturally, these are also the brands that I am excited to work with!

Jennie is a homeowner in Austin, Texas, who recently decided to transform her 1970s bungalow into a cleaner, more efficient home. At first, she felt just as stuck as anyone: Which project to do first?; How to afford it?; Who to hire?; Rather than throwing up her hands, Jennie turned the project into a series of manageable steps.

Dependence on renewable energy and critical minerals will ultimately be better for the world and its people than our current fossil fuel economy, but it’s crucial to remember that as we expand mining, we must do so in a way that minimizes impacts. Battery manufacturing companies are critical in this. Responsible mineral acquisition can benefit companies by increasing their profit, adding security to their supply chain, and enhancing company reputation by preserving habitats, biodiversity, and community sovereignty. In Part Two of this series we will dive deeper into the largest solutions in mining as well as give some insights as to how to make sure you are sourcing minerals responsibly for your products.",

Samuel will explore three major strategies to reduce the environmental and social impacts of mining, along with a few additional approaches that are gaining traction. Whether you’re a battery manufacturer or just curious about the future of sustainable mining, this is a must-read. Responsible mining is still a developing field, yet it holds significant potential for the future as demand for critical minerals grows. As demand for critical minerals increases, we will see more manufacturers and consumers demand responsible mining practices. Additionally, regulatory pressure on mining companies will increase. As technology advances, its integration into mining operations, both large and small, is expected to become more prevalent.  We must tread carefully as we navigate the energy transition. The global scale of mining is set to expand and it is crucial to go about this responsibly. The overall goal is to reduce the environmental impact of mining and enhance the benefits to local communities.

Dependence on renewable energy and critical minerals will ultimately be better for the world and its people than our current fossil fuel economy, but it’s crucial to remember that as we expand mining, we must do so in a way that minimizes impacts. Battery manufacturing companies are critical in this. Responsible mineral acquisition can benefit companies by increasing their profit, adding security to their supply chain, and enhancing company reputation by preserving habitats, biodiversity, and community sovereignty. In Part Two of this series we will dive deeper into the largest solutions in mining as well as give some insights as to how to make sure you are sourcing minerals responsibly for your products.",

              "description": "Hydrogen is often portrayed as a Climate Solutions silver bullet, but many questions remain: How will it be produced, how will it be transported, what will its end uses be? It’s intriguing to consider how we can replicate the solar success story—transforming a once-costly technology into a scalable and cheap technology. With Hydrogen we have a chance to replicate this. Electric Hydrogen, one of climate tech’s first unicorns, is not just drawing inspiration from this playbook; they're rewriting it specifically for hydrogen. Hydrogen's scope is vast, and we aim to lay down the groundwork for understanding it: We will cover: Hydrogen: What is it?; How can it help with Decarbonisation; Current state of the market; Company Deep Dive: Electric Hydrogen.",

Cement might not sound glamorous, but it’s responsible for a 8% of global CO₂ emissions, so if we want to cut carbon fast, cement is exactly where we need to look. But why aren’t we seeing more carbon-free cement offtake? Buckle up: from messy stakeholder ecosystems to razor-thin commodity pricing, we’ll explore the “ABC” (Architecture, Buyers, and Commoditization) of why offtake is so tough. Offtakes are an important step in wide adoption of green cement. Although there are many challenges that exist in gaining offtakes for low-carbon cement, there are many potential first-movers to offtake low-carbon cement. And I’m confident that we are on a path to meaningfully and dramatically reducing the commercial risk of low-carbon cement.",

The good news: plenty of homeowners are cracking the code on all-electric, zero-carbon living. Take Jennie Montano, for example. Jennie is a homeowner in Austin, Texas, who recently decided to transform her 1970s bungalow into a cleaner, more efficient home. At first, she felt just as stuck as anyone: Which project to do first?; How to afford it?; Who to hire?; Rather than throwing up her hands, Jennie turned the project into a series of manageable steps. And because she is a driftie she built it into a roadmap, and shared her decision making process and decisions along the way, to help us learn about the current solutions and friction points.This one’s for every homeowner thinking about decarbonization and every built-environment founder wanting to understand how customers navigate (or get stuck in) this transition.",

Here’s the question everyone’s asking: Should we even rebuild in areas that are practically guaranteed to burn again? The answer isn’t a simple yes or no. In fact, LA’s already got some pretty great tools to help future-proof homes: stricter building codes, better materials, and defensible space. The real problem? Balancing safety, affordability, and speed so people actually have places to live. So today we have Gillian break down the tools and tactics we already have at our disposal. From fire-resistant materials and smarter building codes to defensible spaces and software innovations that cut red tape, Gillian maps out how LA can rebuild safer, faster, and more affordably.",

If so, you’re not alone. The good news: plenty of homeowners are cracking the code on all-electric, zero-carbon living. Take Jennie Montano, for example. Jennie is a homeowner in Austin, Texas, who recently decided to transform her 1970s bungalow into a cleaner, more efficient home. At first, she felt just as stuck as anyone: Which project to do first?; How to afford it?; Who to hire?; Rather than throwing up her hands, Jennie turned the project into a series of manageable steps. And because she is a driftie she built it into a roadmap, and shared her decision making process and decisions along the way, to help us learn about the current solutions and friction points.This one’s for every homeowner thinking about decarbonization and every built-environment founder wanting to understand how customers navigate (or get stuck in) this transition.",
